# Getting comfortable with promises

I'd like to explore why promises are so tricky in the first place, and why so many of us – novices and experts alike – get tripped up by them. I'm also going to offer what I consider to be the singular insight, the one weird trick, that makes promises a cinch to understand. And yes, I really do believe they're not so hard after that!
