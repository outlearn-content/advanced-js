# Living Asynchronously

As soon as you start working on interesting stuff on the web, you'll have to grapple with the fact that the network is super slow compared to a local machine. That's why good web servers and client-side apps are full of asynchronous code. If you have not done a lot of this before, getting good at writing and debugging asynchronously takes some getting used to. We'll get you on your way with two Modules on Promises and another one on debugging asynchronous JavaScript.

Full speed ahead!
