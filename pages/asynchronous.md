# Living Asynchronously

As soon as you start doing interesting stuff, you'll have to grapple with the fact that the network is super slow compared to anything you can ask the local machine to do. So good web servers and client-side apps are full of asynchronous code. If you have not done a lot of this before, getting good at writing and debugging asynchronously takes some getting used to. We'll get you on your way with a Module on Promises and another one on debugging asynchronous JavaScript.

Full speed ahead!
