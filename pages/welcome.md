# Introduction

Greetings! Welcome to Advanced JavaScript Highlights!

There are plenty of basic JavaScript tutorials out there that get you started. But when it comes to developing a real app for real customers, the stakes get higher and you got to get deeper in your JavaScript journey. This learning path will highlight some of the key topics to get you to level up. We'll cover prototypical inheritance, front-end frameworks, hybrid UI frameworks, asynchronous coding, avoiding common pitfalls, and the future of JavaScript.

We start with A Re-introduction to JavaScript which targets experienced developers who want to make sure they are using JavaScript right. We'll then take a careful look at prototypical inheritance. This is a core design feature in JavaScript that differs from lots of other object-oriented languages. If you want to review some of the prerequisites for this module, go check out [Working with Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects) and [Details of the Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model).



Good luck!
