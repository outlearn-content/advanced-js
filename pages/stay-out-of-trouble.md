# Staying Out of Trouble

We just took a deep look into two particular areas, frameworks and asynchronous JavaScript. Now we'll get back to a more general view. Like all tools, JavaScript has it's own idiosyncrasies and ways to shoot yourself in the foot. In JavaScript Garden, you'll get to take a look at some of the most common pitfalls to avoid. It's developed openly in the GitHub so as you discover your own favorite mistakes and trouble spots, go ahead and suggest an addition!

Keep it safe!
