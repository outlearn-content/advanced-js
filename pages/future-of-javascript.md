# Future of JavaScript

The haphazard history of JavaScript has led to all kinds of trouble as people have tried to figure out safe and effective ways to use the language. A lot of things have been tried out, from languages that transpile to JavaScript to frameworks that do a bunch of things for you. And a lot of this experimentation and improvement is also being codified in the new ECMAScript 6 standard. We'll give you some resources to figure out what's coming and how you can get ready.

Finally, you'll see a Module that collects together some awesome ways to continue to master advanced JavaScript.

Moving on!
