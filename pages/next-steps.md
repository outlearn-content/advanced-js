# What Do I Do Now?

There's so much to learn about JavaScript and new cool tools and best practices come up all the time. So this Path does not even try to be comprehensive. Instead, I've assembled some of the awesome resources I've found helpful and pointed out to others that you can check out on your own. There's no denying that JavaScript will continue to play a massive role for user-facing development and it's making inroads into server side as well. It's far from a perfect language but it's getting better and you'd do well to make sure you stay up to date.

If you find top-notch stuff that you enjoy, go ahead the make some suggestions using the feedback widget on the right. I'd love to hear from you.

Take care!
